\section*{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
Being a land of foodaholics, the food delivery market in Bangladesh has flourished immensely over the years. Additionally, since the commencement of the pandemic, there has been a rapid boost in the market size and order volume. Lockdown has forced people to stay indoors and fulfill their cravings, on the contrary, layoffs all over the country has led to a huge number of food entrepreneurs. Unlike other apps, this web application will be a platform where these entrepreneurs with ineffective strategies and zero marketing experiences get to showcase their promising culinary skills. Also, to make sure that their story is being heard, they are not only presented with their wholesome offerings, but also the contexts and backstories behind both the art and the artist.

\section*{Challenge} % (fold)
\label{sec:challenge}
One of the biggest challenges is the maintenance cost.Using a good server for a manageable web application will need a good amount of money. Also, there will be a huge set of data like image, seller information and their account details.Therefore, there may be a chance of higher cost.Second challenge will be the accuracy of data. While paying the bill,it must be checked whether the data entered are correct or not. Lastly, using MySQL for database management can be vulnerable to SQL injection attack, but precaution can be taken to prevent it while designing database .
